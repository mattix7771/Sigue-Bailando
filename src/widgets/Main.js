            <p className=''>Originally from Italy, where the Latin music sets the rhythm for every dance night, she has always harbored a deep passion for dancing. In 2016, she discovered her interest in Cuban Salsa and Dominican Bachata while in Denmark. Since that moment, she has never ceased to dance. By 2022, she redirected her focus toward Bachata Sensual, culminating in the inauguration of the first Bachata school in Esbjerg. Her mission is to instill a deeper connection to the art of dance, fostering an appreciation for the emotional and expressive facets of movement, beyond the mere acquisition of standard figures. She brings good vibes to every lesson.</p>
